# ORCCA
Optimal Randomized Canonical Correlation Analysis

This project is for the python version of ORCCA algorithm.

It depends on Numpy for matrix calculation and works with any CCA calculation package. Here we recommend 

cca zoo
https://github.com/jameschapman19/cca_zoo

for CCA calculation as it provides several other CCA algorithms that can be used in algorithm comparison.
